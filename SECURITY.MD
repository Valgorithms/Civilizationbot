# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the [latest version](https://github.com/VZGCoders/Civilizationbot/releases) of CivilizationBot is supported.
We generally don't support older versions due to maintenance effort and
since we aim to provide a fairly stable upgrade path for new versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've found an issue that likely has no impact to existing users (For example, in a development-only branch)
feel free to raise it via a standard GitHub bug report issue.

If the issue could have a security impact, please use one of the below 
methods to report the vulnerability:

- Directly contact the lead maintainer [@valzargaming](https://github.com/valzargaming). 
  - You will need to login to be able to see the email address on the [GitHub profile page](https://github.com/valzargaming).
  - Alternatively you can send a DM via Discord to valithor.

Please be patient while the vulnerability is being reviewed. Deploying the fix to address the vulnerability
can often take a little time due to the amount of preparation required, to ensure the vulnerability has
been covered, and to create the content required to adequately notify the user-base.

Thank you for keeping CivilizationBot instances safe!
